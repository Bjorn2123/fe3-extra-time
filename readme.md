# Extra Time Frontend 3

During the course Frontend 3 I learned a lot about d3. I wasn’t familiar with d3 at all so it was a very educational course.

Because I wasn’t familiar with d3 I had to look everything up on the internet. Below a list of what I looked up on the internet and what I learned of it.

1. [http://api.jquery.com/append/](http://api.jquery.com/append/) I read information about the append function in d3 because I did not know what it did in my codes. In every example, I checked the append function appeared so I had to understand it. 
2. [https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_attr.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_attr.asp) Information about the definition and usage of the attr method
3. [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp) Information about the javascript variables. I had to look this up to refresh my mind.
